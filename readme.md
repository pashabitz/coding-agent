The goal here is going to create an end-to-end coding AI.
It will take as input:
- A ticket (some work to be done)
- A github repository (where the code is)

It will output:
- A pull request that solves the ticket.


We will build this step by step, starting with simplified problems first, and then gradually adding missing pieces.

# Step  1: Command line interface to make some changes to a local repository
